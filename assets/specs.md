## Project 2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

This second project is your first foray into building a full-stack application. 
You'll be building a web application, which means you'll learn about what it takes 
to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

This is exciting! It's a lot, but we've given you the tools over the past few weeks, 
and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing 
what sort of application you want to build!

You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the app 
yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some 
wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users 
will want to do with the app.

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals â€“ 
scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### Technical Requirements

Build a web application using Node and Express that responds to HTTP Requests and manipulates data.

#### Your application MUST: ####
- [x] Persist Data from the client
- [x] Return data to the client
- [x] Modify persisted data
- [x] Destroy persisted data
- [x] Respond to GET and POST requests
- [x] Serve static content
- [x] Serve dynamic content
- [x] Use a client-side templating library to render JSON from the server
- [x] Use a server-side templating library to render HTML as a response
- [x] Use a CSS framework
- [x] Serve a favicon
- [x] Be deployed online and accessible to the publically-accessible

#### Your repo MUST: ####
- [x] Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- [x] Include user stories

#### Necessary Deliverables: ####
- [x] A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- [x] A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
- [x] A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- [ ] A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- [x] Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
- [x] A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Plan
- Write User stories

> User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application. 
> It's tempting to just make them todo lists for what needs to get done, 
> but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, 
> it'll help you know what to build!

- Pseudo code
- Wireframe
- Write naive code
- Read the docs
- Find a tutorial
- Commit early, commit often.
- Use git branching to try out ideas

## Potential Project Ideas

### Personal Tracker

Build something for yourself that tracks some data!

### Cheerups

The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - 
happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - 
limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like 
and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

### Bookmarket

You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? 
Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

### FourSquare Clone

MongoDB is great for location based data like latitude and longitude.
Allow users to report on their location and find nearby friends.
