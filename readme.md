## Approach

Since all the server-end material was difficult for me to grasp and digest during the short amount of time that we had to learn it, I decided to build a basic app that I already knew how to build and apply the back-end specs to it. 

My biggest struggle was with figuring out which pieces of code pointed at what, and it made me very dizzy at many points along the way. I broke everything down into smaller pieces, and console.log'ed EVERYTHING, so that I could understand what each line of code was doing or returning. I Google'd A LOT and referred to the exercises for help. 

For my CSS framework, I selected Bootstrap since I had learned about it previously in the Front-End Web Development course and already knew how to set it up. However, I do enjoy CSS and styling so I didn't rely too heavily on the framework. 

I used Handlebars as the templating library for both my server- and client-side rendering. Although I had some difficulty figuring it out at first, once I got the hang of it, it was fairly user-friendly.

I was worried about not being able to complete this project in time, but by planning my days out and setting smaller milestones for myself, I was able to stay on schedule.  

## Unsolved Problems
- Removing focus highlight on the delete 'x' buttons
- User login feature (nicety) 
- Delay from the time enter key is pressed to when to-do items are rendered to page
- When a list item spans multiple lines, the "bullet" (delete button) lines up with the bottom line rather than the top
- Being able to articulate what my code does
